How to think recursively?

Thinking recursively involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem individually. Here are some steps that can help you think recursively:

Identify the problem: Clearly understand the problem you are trying to solve.

Divide and conquer: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently.

Identify the base case: Determine what the base case is, which is the condition that stops the recursion.

Recursive case: Define the recursive case, which is the step that reduces the problem to smaller subproblems.

Combine solutions: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.

Consider the stopping condition: Make sure to consider how the recursive calls will eventually stop, otherwise the recursion will continue indefinitely.

Visualize the process: Try visualizing the recursive process, such as drawing a diagram of the function calls and their relationships, to better understand how the solution is being built.

Remember, the key to thinking recursively is breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem individually. Practice and experience will help you become more proficient at thinking recursively.
