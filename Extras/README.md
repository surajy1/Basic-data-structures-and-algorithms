# Extra Data Structures and Algorithms
## Hashing
1. [Map - Count the frequencie (occurances) of integers](https://github.com/y-suraj/C-Plus-Plus-Practicals-and-Tests/blob/main/C%2B%2B%20STL/Maps/Example%201%20-%20Map%20-%20Count%20the%20frequencies%20of%20integers.cpp)
> Time complexity of map(storing and fetching) = **(log N)**, for all test case including **best, average and worst** where N is the number of elements in the map

2. [Unordered Map - Count the frequencie (occurances) of integers](https://github.com/y-suraj/C-Plus-Plus-Practicals-and-Tests/blob/main/C%2B%2B%20STL/Maps/Example%202%20-%20Unordered%20Map%20-%20Count%20the%20frequencies%20of%20integers.cpp)
> Time complexity of map(storing and fetching): = **O(1) for average and best cases, and = O(N) for worst cases**, where N is the number of elements in the map
